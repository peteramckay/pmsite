    <em><p>Eulogy for Sedley V. McKay, delivered by his son, Peter A. McKay on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, at Aaron and Burney Bivens Funeral Home in Orange Park, Fla.</p></em>

    <p>On behalf of my mother Gabrielle, and the rest of our family, I want to thank all of you for coming out today. This really is a great turnout to honor my dad Sedley, especially in light of the storm we just had. We know the travel was difficult for many of you.</p>

   <p>As we deal with our loss today, I think it's worth talking a little about how Sedley dealt with loss in <em>his</em> life. Because he had some really big ones. In some ways, I think loss really shaped him his whole life long.</p>

    <p>He didn't talk about this much. But if we can do so here for just a minute, I think it can help us understand what made Sedley so special. And it can help us understand how we might move on without him, as we must now.</p>

    <p>When Sedley was a child, he lost his own father, Peter Samuel McKay, at a very young age. The family lived on a farm in rural St. James Parish, Jamaica, and my grandfather had a small trucking business helping other local farmers take their crops to market.</p>

    <p>Now, if you've ever been to Jamaica, as I know several of you have, you know it's very hilly and mountainous. Well, one day in 1929, while taking a load of bananas to town, my grandfather's truck plunged over a precipice on those hilly roads, and he died.</p>

    <p>Sedley was not yet 4 years old at the time. <p>

    <p>His older sisters later told me that it was their father's custom to bring back candy for the children whenever he made a run to town. Of course, the day of that fatal crash he never made it to town. </p>

    <p>After the crash, the local people immediately brought Peter Samuel's body back to the house and laid him out on his bed, so it looked like  he was sleeping.</p>

    <p>Little Sedley came into the room and started going through his pockets. And he started crying because there was no candy as usual. But he didn't understand what was going on beyond that. And he never really knew his own father his whole life long.</p>

    <p>Fast-forward many years. Sedley outlived two of his six children -- Colin, who died in 1972 when Sedley was in middle age, and David, who died in 2013 when Sedley was well into his retirement. Both were taken from us too soon by sickle-cell anemia. The tragedy of losing a child is one that is unfathomable, unnatural. Most of us could only imagine.</p>

    <p>Sedley faced other losses through his life, of course. He outlived all 10 of his siblings, for instance, as well as many other relatives and dear friends. But it was these three especially untimely ones, occurring at almost regular intervals in his life -- beginning, middle, and toward the end -- the loss his father, his son, and then another son -- that I think had a particular effect on Sedley.</p>

    <p>And there is where the story becomes a much happier one. Because, to be specific, the effect these losses had on Sedley was to instill a deep empathy, and thus love. Out of the major losses in his life, and all that pain, he created something beautiful and good. </p>

    <p>Officially, Sedley had six children: Ian, Colin, David, Patricia, Lou-Ann, and me. But unofficially, there are so many others who Sedley adopted. Neighbors and friends’ children, and so on, as you heard earlier.</p>

    <p>And why did he do it? Because first and foremost, he identified with them. Having lost his father so young, he knew what he meant for someone else to be in need of a father. And so -- this is crucial -- he did something about it.</p>

    <p>Likewise, having lost some of his children, he valued children all the more. Not just his own children. All children.</p>

    <p>Look out for one another. This was the paramount, cardinal rule that Sedley’s mother, who they called Mimi, drummed into her 10 children. There was clearly a big dose of pure pragmatism behind her saying this, as Sedley and his siblings didn’t have their father to look out for them.</p>

    <p>But in its simplicity, that rule -- that great coping mechanism that Sedley lived by his whole life -- it’s also profound. </p>

    <p>Look out for one another.</p>

    <p>You see, to do that means to put yourself in someone else’s shoes for a moment. To step out of your own selfish interests, your own firsthand view of the world, and see it from someone else’s.</p>

    <p>And how much better would the world be if we all did that a little more, in all things?</p>

    <p>Watch out for one another. We will always have Sedley as our great role model in how to do that. And if we do that, if we watch out for one another, we can get through this great loss. </p>

    <p>I promise you, we can get through -- we can do -- anything.</p>
