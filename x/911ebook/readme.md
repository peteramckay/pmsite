#9/11 E-Book Project

I'm turning some old blog posts into an e-book about my experience witnessing and escaping the 9/11 attack in Lower Manhattan. Material here originally appeared on a blog I maintained in 2011, for the 10th anniversary of the attacks. 

I've since deprecated that blog but would like the writing to live on elsewhere.
