    <h1 class="margin-bottom">Meet the Roscoeheads</h1>
    
    <p class="padded-bottom margin-bottom">Our founding team has diverse experience in technology, media, and more. Below are individual bios for each of our team members -- <a href="#lpbio" target="_self">Lawrence Patrick</a>, <a href="#pmbio" target="_self">Peter McKay</a>, and <a href="#kmbio" target="_self">Katrina Miles</a>.</p>

    <p class="fname" id="lpbio"><strong>Lawrence C. Patrick III,</strong> Chief Executive Officer</p>
    <p><img src="//roscoeblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/lawrence.jpeg" alt="Lawrence Patrick" class="fourcolumn">Lawrence built his first website in 1994, before Netscape was launched. He went on to work on Mercury Center, the first daily news site in the U.S. Lawrence worked in Silicon Valley for Knight-Ridder New Media, launching several web-based products, including NewsLibrary.com, currently the world’s largest newspaper archive. He also worked closely on news products with Zip2, a startup founded by Elon and Kimbal Musk.</p>
    <p>After leaving K-R, Lawrence co-founded Megaschool, one of the first digital textbook companies. He also served as founding president and CEO of Inspire USA Foundation, where he led the U.S. expansion of one of Australia’s leading anti-suicide charities. Before coming to Inspire, he was director of business development and strategy for Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he was responsible for new media, content distribution, intellectual property and corporate partnerships for the jazz world’s largest organization.</p>
    <p>As president and CEO of the Black Alliance for Educational Options, Lawrence led the organization through dramatic early-stage growth. Under his leadership, BAEO helped shape public policy, launched several grassroots campaigns, and received a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation to create a national network of charter schools. Lawrence was selected for a fellowship to attend the Stanford University Graduate School of Business Executive Program for Nonprofit Leaders in 2006.</p>

    <p class="fname" id="pmbio"><strong>Peter McKay,</strong> Chief Product Officer</p>
    <p><img src="../img/pmrumours.jpeg" alt="Peter McKay" class="fourcolumn">Peter is a former Wall Street Journal markets reporter. Over 11 years at the paper, he wrote extensively for both the web and print editions, including daily coverage of the stock-market crash in late 2008. In the months following that historic event, he provided market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets, including CNN, the BBC, Fox News, CNBC, San Francisco's KRON and New York's WCBS on the Journal's behalf. Peter was part of the Journal team that won a 2011 Gerald Loeb Award for breaking coverage of the stock market's "flash crash," and he was a finalist in the same category in 2007. He was part of the Journal staff that as a group won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for breaking coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. In 2002, he was also an ethics fellow at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. In 2009, Florida A&amp;M University's journalism school gave him the Thelma Thurston Gorham Distinguished Alumnus Award. Peter has significant operational responsibility at Roscoe Labs and oversees innovation and development for us.</p>
