        <h2>Introducing Beams</h2>
        <h6 class="margin-bottom">A secure, fast web framework</h6>
        <p>Beams is an open, full-stack framework for building websites, tailored for a future in which the entire web is served using HTTPS encryption.</p>
        <p>The major browser makers, including <a href="//blog.mozilla.org/security/2015/04/30/deprecating-non-secure-http/">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3027525/security/google-will-mark-non-encrypted-websites-with-a-scarlet-letter.html">Google</a>, have become adamant that such a transition needs to happen in response to rising user concerns over privacy. Google has also begun <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/government/cybersecurity/google-to-factor-security-in-search-results/d/d-id/1297862">favoring HTTPS sites</a> in search results. So the pressure on every publisher on the web, big or small, is mounting.</p>
        <p>Beams is built to make the switch to HTTPS easier. Its core is an Nginx script that handles front-end HTTPS validation, reverse-proxies to your content, and maintains performance throughout.</p>
        <p>You can download the current version of Beams, which is in public beta release, from us <a href="../beams-0.2.5.zip">here</a>. Or, if you'd like to participate in development of future releases of Beams, please visit its page on <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams">GitHub</a>, our chief venue for open-source collaboration.</p>
        <p>Beams is (and always will be) free to use under MIT license. We're adding features all the time, with feedback and contributions from the community.</p>
        <p>Together, we want to make the web a better, freer place. Join us.</p>

    <h1>An operating system for news</h1>
    <p>Beams is an open development framework for news sites, emphasizing both security and speed. In fact, our tests show it offers <a href="#trashtalking">an unparalleled combination</a> of both compared to the server software most major news sites now run in production.</p>
    <p>Beams' features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Secure server using Nginx and Node.js.</strong> A simple, fast server stack to get your project up and running quickly using the secure HTTPS protocol. Plus, it uses the latest development tools to do it, so you can upgrade and maintain solid performance at the same time.</li>
       <li><strong>jQuery 2.1.4.</strong> The framework includes a full self-hosted copy of this popular JavaScript library so your project can quickly call functions from it from the client side.</li>
      <li><strong>Ultraresponsive layout.</strong> The Beams layout is based on a 20-column, 4,000-pixel grid. This allows elegant resizing of elements on any size screen, from a large TV down to a smartphone. Video players are also responsive, including support for embedded players for YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosted HTML5 video.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can download the latest version of Beams from us <a href="//roscoelabs.com/beams-0.2.5.zip" onClick=”_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'External Link', 'v0.2.5 download']);”>here</a>, or if you prefer, it's also available via <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams">GitHub</a>, where you can fork it, file bug reports, or contribute code back to make Beams even better.</p>

      <p>Answer: None of their websites run as fast or securely as this one. That's because we run on Beams, and they don't.</p>
      <p>Yet.</p>
      <p>We recently <a href="//roscoelabs.com/blog/20150521-beams0.2.5.html">benchmarked</a> our site server against those of the most popular English-language news sites. None of the above organizations' servers handled batches of 1,000 requests as fast as ours did running Beams, and none used the encrypted HTTPS protocol to protect their site visitors' privacy, as Beams does by default.</p>
      <p>Beams' secret weapons for speed are modern server technologies like Nginx and Node.js -- tools that many news organizations have yet to adopt fully.</p>
      <p>Take a look a look at Beams today to see what it can do for your site. It's open source under MIT license, so you can <a href="../beams-0.2.5.zip">download the framework</a> today and begin innovating yourself. Or, if you prefer, drop the Roscoe Labs team an <a href="mailto:info@roscoelabs.com">email</a> today to see how we might be able to help you implement Beams.</p>

      <span class="margin-bottom"><h3>Why HTTPS for news?</h3></span>
      <p>Among major U.S. news sites, there is currently almost zero use of the HTTPS protocol, which encrypts communication between publishers and site visitors.</p>
      <p>In an era when the NSA, foreign governments, and sundry garden-variety fraudsters are looking to hack anyone they can, this urgently needs to change. Just ask the New York Times.</p>
      <p>On its developer blog in November 2014, the Times <a href="//open.blogs.nytimes.com//2014/11/13/embracing-https/" target="blank">issued</a> a friendly "HTTPS Challenge" to the entire news industry to convert to HTTPS by the end of 2015.</p>
      <p>At Roscoe Labs, we've met the NYT's challenge -- and then some. We've not only converted our own site to HTTPS, but we've provided other publishers with an open tool to do the same, via the Beams framework.</p>
      <p>Please, let's all <a href="//github.com/roscoelabs/beams/wiki/Getting-Started-With-Beams" target="blank">get started</a> protecting users today. Together.</p>

      <h3>Covering the client side too</h3>
      <p>Don't let all the server-side awesomeness fool you. Since Day One, Beams has been built intentionally, proudly, as a <em>full-stack</em> framework, including handy client-side tools as well.</p>
      <p>Beams includes a 20-column ultraresponsive grid to make your site display well on any screen, from a TV down to a smartphone.</p>
      <p>We've also included a self-hosted version of the latest version of jQuery, so you can call on that popular JavaScript library easily, right from the user's browser.</p>
