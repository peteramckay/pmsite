    <p>This is a template page. I'm an entrepreneur, developer, and writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently serving as co-founder and chief product officer of <a href="https://roscoelabs.com">Roscoe Labs</a>, a news technology startup focused on encrypting publishers' websites.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was a Wall Street Journal markets reporter. Over 11 years at the paper, I wrote extensively for both the web and print editions, including daily coverage of the historic stock-market crash in late 2008 that sparked the Great Recession. In the months following that historic event, I also provided market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets, including CNN, the BBC, Fox News, CNBC, San Francisco's KRON and New York's WCBS on the Journal's behalf.</a>
   <p>I was part of the Journal team that won a 2011 Gerald Loeb Award for breaking coverage of the stock market's "flash crash," and I was a finalist in the same category in 2007 for coverage of the merger of Chicago's major financial exchanges. I was also part of the Journal staff that as a group won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for breaking coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
  <p>Prior to joining the Journal in 1999, I worked at the Washington Post, covering local business in Prince William County, Virginia. I'm a native New Yorker, recovering Mets fan, and distinguished alumnus of Florida A&M University's journalism school.</p>
  <p>In general, I'm intrigued by the evolution of media, especially the potential of nimble digital orgs to assume the former role of traditional shops now in decline. I'm also passionate about the open Web and spreading its benefits to more people around the world.</p>

    <p>Hollywood is a neighborhood in the central region of Los Angeles, California. The neighborhood is notable for its place as the home of the U.S. film industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come to be a metonym for the motion picture industry of the United States. Hollywood is also a highly ethnically diverse, densely populated, economically diverse neighborhood and retail business district. This is <a href="//eff.org">a link</a>.</p>
    <p>Hollywood was a small community in 1870 and was incorporated as a municipality in 1903.[3][4] It officially merged with the city of Los Angeles in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry began to emerge, eventually becoming the most recognizable film industry in the world.</p>
