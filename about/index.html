    <h3>Hello, world.</h3>
    <p>I'm a entrepreneur, consultant, and writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently serving as chief product officer and co-founder of <a href="https://roscoelabs.com">Roscoe Labs</a>, a news technology startup. Our mantra is: "Open media. Open communities."​</p>
    <p>Previously, I was an award-winning markets reporter at the Wall Street Journal. I wrote extensively for both the Web and print editions, including daily coverage of the historic stock-market crash in late 2008. In the months following that meltdown, I also provided on-air market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets, including CNN, the BBC, CNBC, San Francisco’s KRON and New York’s WCBS.</p>
    <p>In general, I'm intrigued by the evolution of media, especially the potential of nimble digital orgs to assume the former role of traditional shops now in decline. I'm also passionate about the open Web and spreading its benefits to more people around the world.</p>



<!-- Roscoe bio. Fold this stuff into regular text above...

Peter is a former Wall Street Journal markets reporter. Over 11 years at the paper, he wrote extensively for both the web and print editions, including daily coverage of the stock-market crash in late 2008. In the months following that historic event, he provided market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets, including CNN, the BBC, Fox News, CNBC, San Francisco's KRON and New York's WCBS on the Journal's behalf. Peter was part of the Journal team that won a 2011 Gerald Loeb Award for breaking coverage of the stock market's "flash crash," and he was a finalist in the same category in 2007. He was part of the Journal staff that as a group won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for breaking coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks. In 2002, he was also an ethics fellow at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. In 2009, Florida A&M University's journalism school gave him the Thelma Thurston Gorham Distinguished Alumnus Award. Peter has significant operational responsibility at Roscoe Labs and oversees innovation and development for us.
