   <span><h1>Howdy.</h1>
   <p>I'm a Northern California-based writer and hacker focused on digital media. I use this site to experiment on personal web projects, including:</p>
  <ul>
     <li><strong>Desmond.</strong> A responsive CSS theme for static web pages. Full demo is <a href="x/desmond">here</a>.</li>
     <li><strong>Beams.</strong> An Nginx webserver for publishing sites securely via the HTTPS protocol. The page you're reading right now was served using Beams.</li>
     <li><strong>Beams Ads.</strong> A jQuery plugin for displaying a single popup ad on a webpage, once per user per visit. Demo is <a href="x/beams_ads">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>All the above are free to use under MIT license. Source code available via my <a href="https://github.com/peteramckay">GitHub page</a>.</p>
   <p>I'm also a longtime content creator. I currently write about the economy for <a href="https://news.vice.com/story/author/peter-a-mckay">Vice Money</a>, and I have a tech blog as well, at <a href="https://indizr.com">indizr.com</a>.</p>
   <p>I started in journalism in the late '90s as a reporter in the Northern Virginia suburbs for the Washington Post. I then got hired away by the Wall Street Journal, where I reported on financial markets from 1999 to 2010, writing for both print and digital. </p>
   <p>I was part of the Journal staff that collectively won the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for breaking coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks next door to our headquarters in Lower Manhattan. I provided daily coverage of the market crash in late 2008 that sparked the Great Recession. In the months following that historic event, I also provided market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets, including CNN, the BBC, Fox News, CNBC, San Francisco's KRON and New York's WCBS on the Journal's behalf.</p>
   <p>In 2011, I was part of the Journal team that won a Gerald Loeb Award for breaking coverage of the stock market's "flash crash." I was also a finalist in the same category in 2007 for coverage of the merger of Chicago's two major financial exchanges.</p>
   <p>I eventually took a buyout from the Journal to co-found Roscoe Labs, which focused at first on mobile news video and later on encrypted publishing infrastructure. I was the team's chief product officer, although that role also came to entail a lot of core development work, as we were such a ragtag bunch. Hence my recent interest in more technical stuff. </p>
   <p>We shut down Roscoe in 2016, as the business wasn't working out. But my interest in improving how people get their news and information, and how organizations can better adapt to the digital world, endures.</p>
   <p>If you want to connect regarding such stuff, I'm reachable anytime via <a href="https://twitter.com/peteramckay">Twitter</a> or email at peter [at] indizr.com.</p>
