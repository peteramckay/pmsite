   <h1>Howdy.</h1>

   <p>I'm a writer, hacker, and consultant focused on digital media. I use this site to work on personal web projects, including:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Desmond.</strong> A responsive CSS theme for static web pages. Full demo is <a href="x/desmond">here</a>.</li>
     <li><strong>Beams.</strong> An Nginx webserver for publishing sites securely via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>. The page you're reading right now is served using Beams.</li>
     <li><strong>Beams Ads.</strong> A jQuery app for displaying a single popup ad on a page, once per user per site visit. Demo is <a href="x/beams_ads">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
   <p>All the above are free to use under MIT license. Source code available on my <a href="https://github.com/peteramckay">GitHub page</a>.</p>
   <p>I'm also a longtime content creator. I currently cover the economy for <a href="https://news.vice.com/story/author/peter-a-mckay">Vice Money</a>, and I have a tech blog as well, at <a href="https://indizr.com">indizr.com</a>.</p>
   <p>I started in journalism in the late '90s as a reporter in the Northern Virginia suburbs for the Washington Post. I then got hired away in 1999 by the Wall Street Journal, where I reported on financial markets for 11 years, writing for both print and digital. </p>
   <p>While at the Journal, I was part of the staff that shared the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for breaking coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks next door to our headquarters in Lower Manhattan. I provided daily coverage of the market crash in late 2008 that sparked the Great Recession. In the months following that historic event, I also provided market analysis for more than 100 broadcast outlets around the world on the Journal's behalf.</p>
   <p>In 2011, I was part of the Journal team that won a Gerald Loeb Award for breaking coverage of the stock market's "flash crash," caused by a massive computer glitch. I was also a finalist in the same category in 2007 for coverage of the merger of Chicago's two major financial exchanges.</p>
   <p>I eventually took a buyout from the Journal to co-found Roscoe Labs, which focused at first on mobile news video and later on encrypted publishing infrastructure. I was (formally) the team's chief product officer and (informally) its chief developer.</p>
   <p>We shut down Roscoe in 2016, as the business wasn't working out. But my interest in improving how people get their news and information, and how organizations can better adapt digitally, endures.</p>
